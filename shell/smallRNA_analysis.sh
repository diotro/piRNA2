## CDF plot of assemblbed loci accounting for piRNA
#X-axis: number of pre-pachytene loci identified by the flowchart 
#Y-axis #1: fraction of uniquely mapping pre-pachytene piRNA reads accounted for. 
#Y-axis #2: fraction of all mapping pre-pachytene piRNA reads accounted for. Once a locus accounts for a multi-mapper, all of its reads are considered accounted for. 
#Y-axis #3: fraction of pre-pachytene piRNA species accounted for. 
#Use the loci in order (greatest to least) of accounting for piRNAs.

## another set of three CDF plots, with the same Y-axes, but with the X-axis being the % of genome (cumulative) the pre-pachytene piRNA loci cover, also in the same order of (greatest to least) of accounting for piRNAs.
